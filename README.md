# CloudBeaver Client (Go)

A Go client package that provides a transient connection between [terraform-provider-cloudbeaver](https://github.com/hopopops/terraform-provider-cloudbeaver) and [cloudbeaver](https://dbeaver.com/docs/cloudbeaver/). You do not need to compile this package; the HashiCups provider uses it as a dependency.
